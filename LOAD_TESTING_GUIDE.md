# 🧪 AI ChatBot Load Testing Guide

## 📋 **Overview**

This guide helps you understand your chatbot's capacity limits and plan for scaling. You'll learn how many users can use your chatbot simultaneously and what happens when you reach those limits.

---

## 🎯 **What You'll Discover**

### **Key Metrics:**
- **Concurrent Users**: How many people can chat simultaneously
- **Response Times**: How fast your chatbot responds under load
- **Throughput**: Messages per second your system can handle
- **Failure Rate**: When and how your system starts failing
- **Bottlenecks**: What limits your capacity (CPU, Memory, etc.)

---

## 🛠️ **Setup Load Testing**

### **1. Install Load Testing Tools**

```bash
# Install load testing dependencies
cd load_testing
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **2. Start Your ChatBot**

```bash
# Make sure your chatbot is running
./deploy.sh deploy

# Or for development
source venv/bin/activate
python start_backend.py
```

---

## 🧪 **Running Load Tests**

### **Option 1: Simple Load Test (Easiest)**

```bash
cd load_testing
python simple_load_test.py
```

**Choose from these scenarios:**
- **Light Load**: 5 users, 3 messages each (Good for initial testing)
- **Medium Load**: 10 users, 5 messages each (Typical usage)
- **Heavy Load**: 20 users, 5 messages each (Peak usage)
- **Stress Test**: 50 users, 3 messages each (Breaking point)

### **Option 2: Advanced Load Test (Professional)**

```bash
# Install Locust (professional load testing)
pip install locust

# Run advanced load test
cd load_testing
locust -f locust_test.py --host=http://localhost:8000
```

**Then:**
1. Open http://localhost:8089 in your browser
2. Set number of users and spawn rate
3. Start the test and monitor results

### **Option 3: Capacity Analysis (System Health)**

```bash
cd load_testing
python capacity_analyzer.py
```

**This analyzes:**
- Current system resources (CPU, Memory, Disk)
- Docker container performance
- API responsiveness
- Estimated capacity limits

## 📊 **Understanding Your Results**

### **🎯 Current Capacity Estimates**

Based on typical hardware configurations:

| **Hardware** | **Concurrent Users** | **Daily Messages** | **Use Case** |
|--------------|----------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **2GB RAM, 1 CPU** | 5-10 users | 2,000-5,000 | Small blog/website |
| **4GB RAM, 2 CPU** | 15-25 users | 8,000-15,000 | Medium business |
| **8GB RAM, 4 CPU** | 30-50 users | 20,000-35,000 | Large application |
| **16GB RAM, 8 CPU** | 60-100 users | 50,000-80,000 | Enterprise |

### **⏱️ Response Time Guidelines**

**Excellent Performance:**
- Average response time: < 2 seconds
- 95th percentile: < 5 seconds
- No failed requests

**Good Performance:**
- Average response time: 2-5 seconds
- 95th percentile: < 10 seconds
- < 1% failed requests

**Needs Improvement:**
- Average response time: > 5 seconds
- 95th percentile: > 10 seconds
- > 5% failed requests

### **🚨 Warning Signs**

**System is at capacity when:**
- Response times increase dramatically
- Error rates rise above 5%
- CPU usage consistently > 80%
- Memory usage > 90%
- Many requests timeout

## 📈 **Scaling Recommendations**

### **Based on Load Test Results:**

#### **If you can handle < 10 concurrent users:**
```
🎯 Current Scale: Small Application
💡 Immediate Actions:
   - Add more RAM (upgrade to 4GB+)
   - Consider faster CPU
   - Optimize memory window (reduce from 20 to 10)
   
📊 Estimated Cost: $20-40/month hosting
```

#### **If you can handle 10-25 concurrent users:**
```
🎯 Current Scale: Medium Application  
💡 Scaling Options:
   - Horizontal scaling (multiple servers)
   - Load balancer
   - Redis caching
   - CDN for frontend
   
📊 Estimated Cost: $50-100/month hosting
```

#### **If you can handle 25+ concurrent users:**
```
🎯 Current Scale: Large Application
💡 Advanced Scaling:
   - Microservices architecture
   - Database clustering
   - Auto-scaling groups
   - Multi-region deployment
   
📊 Estimated Cost: $100-500/month hosting
```

## 🔧 **Performance Optimization Tips**

### **Backend Optimizations:**

1. **Reduce Memory Window**
```python
# In config.py
MEMORY_WINDOW = 5  # Instead of 20 for high-volume scenarios
```

2. **Optimize Temperature**
```python
# Lower temperature = faster responses
TEMPERATURE = 0.3  # Instead of 0.7 for speed
```

3. **Enable Caching**
```python
# Add Redis caching for repeated queries
# Already configured in docker-compose.yml
```

4. **Connection Pooling**
```python
# Configure database connection pooling
# Add to backend/server.py
```

### **Frontend Optimizations:**

1. **Enable Compression**
```nginx
# Already configured in nginx.conf
gzip on;
gzip_types text/plain text/css application/javascript;
```

2. **Cache Static Assets**
```nginx
# Cache CSS, JS, images for 1 year
location /static/ {
    expires 1y;
    add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";
}
```

# Solution: Make sure chatbot is running
./deploy.sh status
./deploy.sh logs
```

**2. "OpenAI API Rate Limits"**
```bash
# Solution: Use test mode or multiple API keys
# Edit load test scripts to use mock responses
```

**3. "Memory Errors"**
```bash
# Solution: Reduce concurrent users or memory window
# Monitor with: docker stats
